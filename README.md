# change background color
 
in this simple html page user can change background color by clicking on buttons that he wants. then the background color changes, the name of colors shows and the border of choosen button will be green . The second fiture I think I have to  mention is that when the page refreshed the background color will be choosen randomly by using Math.random function.
